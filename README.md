Helper scripts to backup/restore IntelliJ IDEA project metadata files

This is a couple of very basic simple scripts to backup/restore IntelliJ metadata files when using the "file-based"
approach instead of the ".idea" directory based approach.

This has only been tested on Mac OS X, but theoretically should work on any platform that Perl is available on.

Use at your own risk.
